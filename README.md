#### - In the following analysis we will be working with a Dataset about some questions compiled by the team at FiveThirtyEight, and address to the American Star Wars fan base.
#### - The purpose of the team with this surveys was to answer some questions such as: was the Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back, the favourite movie from the fans? If not which was? What were their favourite characters? Does Education levels from the side of the fans, present themselves as a differentiator in the rating of the 6 Star Wars movies from the saga?  Do we see differences in the fan base tastes when we segment the data in terms of Gender.  And what was the most seen movie of all?
#### - Because the Dataset had some dirty datapoints and some of the data was inserted in a columns dependency level we will need, prior to do the analysis, to do some cleaning. So first we will put our hands in the dough by cleaning what needs to be cleaned from the Dataset, and then we will do our analysis by resorting to some plots in order to better grasp the full potential of the data and to try to unlock some of its questions.
